**Dear All,**

**As discussed below are the assignment. Adhere to time lines.**

**Task Details:**

Attached below is a dataset sheet of a log of all the classes we have hosted on Zoom, with student attendance details and feedback scores given by students for each class.

1. We’d like you to review the data, analyze it, and provide insights, observations, and actionable items based on your findings.
2. Looking at the dataset, please suggest which timings and time zones we should schedule classes during launch. (Aim - our classes should sell out)
3. Looking at the dataset, please suggest what our class curation should be. (which teachers should teach during launch, and which classes should they teach)

**Overview:**

We are an online edtech startup operating in the US for kids aged 8-13 years. Currently, we have a beta testing website where parents can sign up their kids for live online classes conducted in small groups of students.

In the dataset, you’ll find information collected after parents submit an enrollment for their child. We also collect feedback from kids after each class.

Here’s what a few columns in the dataset indicate:

-   Attended: Did the child attend the class?
-   Concepts: Were the concepts or topics taught in the class clear to the child?
-   Interested: Was the topic interesting and enjoyable for the child?
-   Another Class: Is the child interested in taking another class with the - same teacher?
